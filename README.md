# Mini_Project_7


This is the README for my Mini Project 7 for the IDS706 - Data Engineering Systems class at Duke University.

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to translate my learning in Rust so far to a CLI tool. Since I am interested in achieving financial freedom
as early as possible, and one of the easiest way to do so is by investing early & compounding your return and/or interests, I will build a
simple CLI tool that calculates the total investment balance from user inputs.
